## Overview

<2–4 sentences: what this repo does, where it sits in the org, and what the current strategic focus is.>

## Active Gaps

<!--
Each gap is a single block in this exact shape. Workflow tooling parses the
**Status**, **Priority**, **Owner**, and **Target Completion** fields, so do
not rename them. Status transitions In Progress → In Review → Completed are
written by workflows; do not edit those by hand.
-->

## Completed Gaps

<!--
When a workflow sets a gap to Completed, the gap stays here. Quarterly archive
sweeps move gaps older than 6 months into the Archive section.
-->

<!-- (none yet) -->

---

## Blocked

<!--
Gaps with Status: Blocked. Each must include "Blocked By: ..." pointing at
the dependency (a GitHub issue, an external dependency, or another GAP-NNN).
-->

<!-- (none) -->

---

## Archive (Decided Not To Do or Superseded)

<!--
Gaps that were closed without completion. Each must include a one-paragraph
reason. Retain for institutional memory.
-->

<!-- (none) -->
